# Introduction

This assignment was a deliverable as part of the Supervised Learning module for the University of Cape Town MSc Data Science.

There were two sections, designed to test supervised learning methods on the classic MNIST dataset, as well as a different student chosen dataset.

This assignment was completed during my intitial learning of both supervised learning, and RMarkdown - hence there are some basic structuring issues, and some redundent tests.

## Question 1

A selection of digits from the classic MNIST dataset are used to compare various supervised learning techniques, from SVM to NNs. PCA is used to preprocess the data in various tests.

## Question 2

The dataset from the first phase of the Zillow Kaggle competition is used. Unfortunately, the results weren't submitted to Kaggle on time so it was not possible to get an actual comparison on the Kaggle leaderboard.

An initial exploration of the data is followed by some focused tests spanning multiple linear regression (best subset approach), and NN's.
